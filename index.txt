<p class="reflec" align="center"><font size="5"> For this quarter, we learned about CSS. Learning about this topic, for me, wasn't easy. In fact, I still do have a bit of a difficult time trying to code in CSS, since there are newer terms for me to understand. I can't deny that I made several failed outputs about using CSS, but I do try my best to understand where I am wrong. Using CSS is still a concept that is a bit new to me and learning the topics under it is quite difficult, which is why I will try very hard to study it well. I will also ask my classmates and companions, who take an interest in coding, to help me comprehend CSS and how it works better! Even though I have outputs that aren't really the best, I try to tell myself to not feel regret, because I did and tried everything I could to make an output. Fighting for the next quarter! >o< </font></p>
